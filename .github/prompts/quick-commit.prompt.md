description: Stage all changes and commit with a descriptive message
mode: agent
---

1. Run `git status` to see the current state
2. Run `git diff` to understand the changes
3. Stage all changes with `git add -A`
4. Create a commit with a clear message that:
   - Starts with a type prefix (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:)
   - Briefly describes what changed
   - Uses imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Ends with the trailer: `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`

Example: `feat: add product search functionality`
